To keep the description general
enough to be used with other puzzles, the algorithm enumerates and tests all k-
length sequences without repetitions of the elements of a given universe U . We
build the sequences of k elements by the following steps:
1. Recursively generating the sequences of k âˆ’ 1 elements
2. Appending to each such sequence an element not already contained in it.
